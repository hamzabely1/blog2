  <p>Objective
Players work with their team to break the enemy Nexus before the enemy team breaks theirs. League of
Legends is a complex game which involves both high-level strategy and fast-paced gameplay. Skilled
players know how to beat the opponent in front of them, while keeping the macro-elements in mind to
support their team to victory.
"I have always been on some type of sports team,
pretty much my whole life, but with esports
instead of relying on physical strength, itâ€™s more
like relying on critical thinking skills. It's
challenging but a great team to be part of!"</p>
